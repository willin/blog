# File naming

## Routing Slug

Use `/folder/[slug]/index.jsx` instead of `/folder/[slug].jsx`.

In `Next.js` project, folder tree may look like this:

```plain
.
├── _app.tsx
├── _document.tsx
├── index.tsx
└── posts
    └── [slug].tsx
```

However, this way is not extendable, when we need to add a sub page like `/post/[slug]/comments`, you need to change the previous file name.

The best practise is that:

```plain
ROOT/pages/
├── _app.tsx
├── _document.tsx
├── index.tsx
└── posts
    └── [slug]
        └── index.tsx
```

Similar, in `Nuxt.js` project, you may adapt it to this way:

```plain
ROOT/pages/
├── index.vue
└── posts
    └── _slug
        └── index.vue
```

## Do not use `UPPERCASE` in file names

Especially in routing directories. It's wierd to see an URL like this:

```plain
https://example.com/SomePath/WithUppercase?Params=something
```

URL should be case insensitive.

# Data Structure

## Do not use `UPPERCASE` in data structure

Almost all data stuctures can be generated automatically, by using scripts among with MySQL, Graphql, OpenAPI etc. If you use all lowercase naming, you have no need worry about the casing issues.

BAD:

```javascript
{
  "createdAt": "2021-05-22 16:00:00"
}
```

GOOD:

```javascript
{
  "created_at": "2021-05-22 16:00:00"
}
```

#

# Params, State or Storage

## When to use params

Unique IDs, such as:

- `/post/:slug`
- `/product/:id`
- `/anything/detail/:id`

Do not use paths like `/anything/detail` to show a single fetched data. When you share the link to others, they will get a `404 error`.

## When to use states

Such as dark mode status, localization config, page/component data to share.

## When to use storage like LocalStorage

Persistize a state, or offline data.
