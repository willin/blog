## Prepare Job

1. Prepare a domian, such as `example.com`. Now, add a website in [cloudflare-dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and build your domain. It maybe cost you about 30min.
2. Select your site and domain, [Enable Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/get-started/enable-email-routing/). It maybe cost you about 5min.
3. Install warngler for delpoy cf worker. Ensure your node version >= 16.13.0 and run :

```sh
npm install wrangler@latest -g
```

## Setup

1. Get the code

```sh
git clone git@github.com:willin/cloudflare-send-email-service.git
```

2. Deploy your worker

```sh
wrangler deploy  --name send-email-worker-service
```

3. Config DNS records

Add a TXT record to your domain with the following values:

- Name: `yourdomain.com`
- Value: `v=spf1 a mx include:relay.mailchannels.net ~all`

Note: If you're facing [Domain Lockdown](https://support.mailchannels.com/hc/en-us/articles/16918954360845-Secure-your-domain-name-against-spoofing-with-Domain-Lockdown) error, follow the below steps:

- Name: `_mailchannels.yourdomain.com`
- Value: `v=mc1 cfid=yourdomain.workers.dev` (the value of `cfid` will also be present in the error response)

4. Setup DKIM

This step is optional, but highly recommended. DKIM is a DNS record that helps prevent email spoofing. You may follow the steps listed in the [MailChannels documentation](https://support.mailchannels.com/hc/en-us/articles/7122849237389-Adding-a-DKIM-Signature) to set up DKIM for your domain.
